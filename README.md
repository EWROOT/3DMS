# 3DMS

- Project Description:
  The goal is to create something as powerful as blender but with a much simpiler and easy to use interface.
  Features:
  - Modelling
    - VPL Style Tooling: A single tool modified via a VPL
    - 3DView
      - Pre-processing 2D Views all quadrant & deflection to set precisions refered to as Rotational Sets
        - Rotating views would link together pregenerated image files
        - Movement Preprocessing of Rotational Sets 
        - Movement & Rotation as much as possible to be loaded from memory instead of processed on the fly
        - Auto-precision detection based on system resources
        - Priority of Pre-Processing based on probability
